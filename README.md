# Firefox UI: Theme Tweaks and Bottom Tabs

<img src="191104 - Firefox theme and layout @2x.png" width="669" height="521">

In MacOS there is a menu bar on top. So browser tabs should be positioned on the bottom of the screen to make it easier to aim them.

And I hate that circle around the Back button. So as full-width search panel on bottom.

Also the color theme was changed to be less contrast.
